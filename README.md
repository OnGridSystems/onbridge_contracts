# Onbridge NFT Gateway Ethereum Contracts

Gateway contracts are responsible on locking NFT token on one side (origin or host or L1 network) then creating its twin on another chain (guest or L2 net). 
Upon withdrawal the system works in opposite direction - guest token gets burnt and gets released on L1 side.
